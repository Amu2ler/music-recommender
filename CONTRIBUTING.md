# 🧩 Contributing Guide

## Branching strategy

- `main` → stable code only
- `arthur-dev`, `semih-dev`, `abdoulaye-dev` → personal branches
- New features: create `feature/<feature-name>` from your branch

## Workflow

1. Pull latest from your dev branch
2. Commit often with clear messages
3. Push to your branch
4. Create a Pull Request → `main`
5. Another member reviews before merge

## Naming conventions

- Branches: `feature/audio-ingestion`
- Commits: `feat: add Milvus integration` / `fix: bug in audio parser`
